# jQuery Mobile Scroll Event [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/DeuxHuitHuit/jQuery-mobile-scroll-event.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/DeuxHuitHuit/jQuery-mobile-scroll-event)

Patch trying to add "normal" scroll events on mobiles devices supporting touch events

## Dependancy

- jQuery v1.7+

## Usage

*Soon*

## Inspiration

We used (and copied) a lot of code from those projects, so we though that we should link to them.
We are not looking to replace those libraries. We just want to have our old desktop code
working on mobile devices (mainly iOs). Do not be afraid to try them out too!
